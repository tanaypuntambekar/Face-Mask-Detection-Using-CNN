# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN

Link to the Dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset
The Dataset contains over 7000 Images.

We will use images to build a CNN model using TensorFlow to detect if you are wearing a face mask or not.

It’s the year of 2021, we all learned the importance of mask in our lives. As life slowly returns to normal, there are increased crowd volume in the public space. Although some states have lifted mask requirements, it is still mandated at indoor public places like airports and hospitals. But it’s difficult and inefficient to inspect the large crowd with labor screening. So, the goal of this project is to build a face mask detection system using deep learning algorithms.
